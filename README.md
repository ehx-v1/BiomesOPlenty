**Biomes O' Plenty** is a **Minecraft mod** that adds **over 50 new biomes** to the Overworld, Nether, and End. From Lavender Fields to Redwood Forests and many more, all of our biomes are decorated with a variety of **new trees, flowers, and plants!**

This fork will heavily rework the mod history, obliterating the term "removed biome" - if a biome ever existed in Biomes O'Plenty, it will exist in the latest version of this fork. Additionally, many of the BoP biomes will also be enhanced with all-new custom structures, since custom flora adds rather little exploration value. I have no ETA for when I get around to actually doing any of this, though.

-----------------

**Note:** To use the mod on a **server**, you must set the **level-type** setting in your server's config file to **biomesoplenty**
